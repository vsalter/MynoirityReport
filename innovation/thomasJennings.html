		Thomas Jennings was the first African-American to receive a patent but his greatest accomplishments stemmed from his contributions to the abolishment movement and the fight for legal rights of African Americans. Thomas was born in 1791 in New York City to a free family, which allowed him to learn the skills to eventually become a tailor as an adult. He met a woman named Elizabeth from Delaware who would become his wife. They lived in New York City and had three children: Matilda Jennings, Elizabeth Jennings, and James Jennings. Thomas would become one of the best tailors in the city and eventually open his own clothing store on Church St.

		As Thomas’ clothing business continued to grow, he started to receive a large amount of inquiries on how to clean his clothing items that were made of delicate materials. Thomas took great pride in his work and hated to see his creations soiled and unable to be cleaned. He would experiment with different cleaning methods in hopes of finding a remedy to the problem. He would create a process he called “dry-scouring” that became his solution to this problem. This process is what we now know as dry-cleaning and widely used around the world. In 1820, Jennings applied for a patent for his dry-scouring process. Due to his status as a free man, Thomas was awarded his patent a year later on March 3, 1821. Thomas would go on to make a lot of money over the years due to his invention and use these funds to help his community and other African Americans across the nation.

		Elizabeth Jennings was not as fortunate as her husband, Thomas, to be born into freedom. Contrarily, she was born as a slave and converted to the status of indentured servant. She became eligible for emancipation in 1827, and Thomas used his new fortune to aid in the process. This would be the start of his philanthropic efforts but definitely not the end. In the same year, Thomas along with other black business leaders was instrumental in establishing the Freedom’s Journal. The Freedom’s Journal was the nation’s first African American Newspaper. Thomas was also an essential member of the first annual Convention of the People of Color in Philadelphia and served as the assistant secretary. In addition to these roles, he was a founding member and trustee of the Abyssinian Baptist Church. The church was the first black Baptist church in the state of New York.

		Thomas Jennings’ passion for legal rights of blacks was passed onto his children. In 1854 his daughter, Elizabeth, was forcibly removed from a streetcar in New York City. The streetcar was designated for Caucasian Americans and when asked to remove the streetcar Elizabeth refused. Thomas organized a movement against racial segregation on public transit in the city of New York. Elizabeth would file a case against New York City streetcars. Thomas’ status in the community along with the fortune he had built due to his patent helped her hire the law firm of Culver, Parker, and Arthur. Elizabeth would be represented by Chester A. Arthur, who would go on to become the 21st president of the United States. In 1855 Elizabeth won her case and a decade later all New York City streetcar companies had stopped practicing segregation. The experience with his daughter caused for Thomas to create the Legal Rights Association in 1855 along with James Smith and Rev. James Pennington. Through the Legal Rights Association, they were able to organize and fund additional challenges to discrimination and segregation while helping blacks gain the legal representation needed to take cases to court.

		Thomas Jennings died on February 11, 1859. Throughout his life he built a legacy that would last the test of time. Thomas will be remembered for becoming the first black person to receive a patent and using his fortune to help other African Americans in the fight against discrimination and segregation. His long list of accomplishments includes being the founding member of many early philanthropic rights organizations such as the Legal Rights Association, Wilberforce Society, New York African Society for Mutual Relief, Phoenix Society, Abyssinian Baptist Church, and the New York Vigilance Committee. He has paved the way for all black innovators and entrepreneurs, and his spirit still lives on today.
